          Last updated: Dec 8, 2025
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Route 25, operated by rakTech LLC (“Route 25,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), provides tools and features for Pokémon TCG collectors, including logging pulls, tracking collections, facilitating trades, and interacting with other users (the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Route 25 is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, Game Freak, or Creatures Inc.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">2. Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You may use some parts of the Service anonymously at first, but creating an authenticated account (for example, using a third-party login provider) may be required for trading, syncing data, or accessing additional features. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">3. User Content</h2>
        <p>
          The Service may allow you to upload, submit, or store content, including images, text, and other materials related to your Pokémon TCG collection (“User Content”). This may include photos of cards for documentation, pulls, or trade purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that you will not upload or share User Content that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is harmful, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
          <li>Is misleading, manipulated, or fraudulent, including card photos intended to deceive other users about card identity, condition, or legitimacy;</li>
          <li>Violates applicable laws or the rights of others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Uploading photos of cards you own for purposes such as documentation or trading is permitted. You retain ownership of your User Content, but grant Route 25 a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, display, and use such content solely as necessary to operate and improve the Service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">4. Trading Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Route 25 provides tools to facilitate trades between users, including an escrow system, card photo review tools, and tracking management. Trades conducted through the Service are considered final once both parties have confirmed them. Route 25 does not reverse or unwind trades and does not serve as a dispute manager or arbitrator.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-6 font-semibold text-lg">4.1 Escrow Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          By participating in trades through the Service, you acknowledge that Route 25 may store and manage trade details, confirmations, status updates, and other related information until both parties satisfy the conditions of the trade. Route 25 acts as a neutral facilitator and does not buy, sell, or take ownership of cards being traded.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not authenticate, professionally grade, or guarantee the condition or accuracy of the cards involved in a trade. We may perform a best-effort automated and/or manual review of card images and related information to assess apparent legitimacy and condition; however, these checks are not guaranteed. The Service provides multiple stages where you may review, inspect, and confirm trade details, photos, and terms. By finalizing a trade, you acknowledge that you have had adequate opportunity to review all information and assume full responsibility for the trade.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-6 font-semibold text-lg">4.2 Card Photo Checks</h3>
        <p>
          Route 25 may use automated tools, machine learning, or manual review to analyze card images submitted by users, including checking that an image likely contains a Pokémon TCG card and evaluating apparent condition or legitimacy indicators. These checks are provided on a best-effort basis and are not a guarantee of authenticity, rarity, grade, or value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users remain solely responsible for the accuracy of card information and for reviewing all photos and details before committing to a trade.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-6 font-semibold text-lg">4.3 Shipping &amp; Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          The Service may allow users to enter, store, and display tracking information for shipped items. Route 25 may format or interpret tracking numbers and show related status updates where available. Route 25 does not control shipping carriers and does not guarantee delivery times, delivery success, or the accuracy of tracking information.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-6 font-semibold text-lg">4.4 Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          Because trades are final once confirmed, Route 25 does not manage, mediate, or adjudicate disputes between users. Route 25 does not reverse trades, recover items, or enforce agreements beyond the tools provided prior to confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are solely responsible for evaluating trade terms, reviewing photos, verifying details, and confirming the accuracy of all information before finalizing a trade. The Service is designed to provide several review stages to help you make informed decisions, but ultimate responsibility for completing a fair trade rests with the participants.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manipulate trade systems or attempt to defraud other users;</li>
          <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;</li>
          <li>Create fraudulent or duplicate accounts for abusive or deceptive purposes;</li>
          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers;</li>
          <li>Use automated tools to scrape, harvest, or collect data from the Service without permission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Route 25 name, branding, logo, graphics, and original design elements of the Service are the property of rakTech LLC and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pokémon names, trademarks, and related imagery are the property of their respective owners. They are used in the Service only for descriptive or nominative purposes. Route 25 does not claim ownership of third-party technologies, platforms, or intellectual property used to operate or support the Service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Route 25 may rely on third-party services, such as authentication providers, analytics tools, and shipping carriers. We are not responsible for the availability, performance, or data practices of these third parties. Your use of such services may be governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">8. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Route 25 does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any analyses or evaluations (including card condition or legitimacy checks) will be accurate or reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You use the Service at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, rakTech LLC and its officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or for any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service;</li>
          <li>Any conduct or content of other users or third parties, including fraudulent or misleading behavior;</li>
          <li>Loss, damage, or delay of shipments or traded items;</li>
          <li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In no event shall the total liability of rakTech LLC exceed fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50).
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">10. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms, engaged in harmful behavior, or otherwise used the Service in a way that may cause harm to other users or to Route 25.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold text-xl">11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
